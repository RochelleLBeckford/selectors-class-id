            <h2>What are Selectors?</h2>

                <li class="list-format">
                    Selectors are used to determine which HTML elements(s) are styled
                </li>

                <li class="list-format">
                    The most common type of selector is the "type selector", which selects all matching elements on the webpage for styling.
                </li>

                <li class="list-format">
                    For instance:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img src="img/a-type-selector.png" alt="Type Selector Image">
                        </li>

                        <li class="list-format">
                            As shown from the image above, the comnents can be replaced with the desired decorations to be applied to the &lt;div&gt; element in the linked HTML file.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- ~ This section will describe what the Class and Id Selectors -->
        <section>
            <h2>Class and Id Selectors</h2>
            <hr>

            <ul>
                <li class="list-format">
                    HTML elements can be selected by their HTML attributes.
                </li>

                <li class="list-format">
                    An example that follows selects elements with a "class" of "class-name" or an "id" of "id-name":
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img src="img/b-class-id-select-element.png" alt="Class and Id Used to Select Elements">
                        </li>

                        <li class="list-format">
                            Selecting an element by "class" is done using a period ".", and used to style multiple elementd with a matching "class" attribute.
                        </li>

                        <li class="list-format">
                            Selecting an element by "id" is done by using a hashtag "#", and is used to style single element with a matching "id" attribute.
                        </li>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            There is a way to be even more specific:
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-format">
                            <img src="img/c-speciffic-class-id.png" alt="More specific Element along with a Class or Id Used">
                        </li>

                        <li class="list-format">
                            Instead of selecting every element with a matching class only "div" elements that either have a class of "class-name" or an "id" of "id-name".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This kind of selection is also known as "targeting".
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    </main>
